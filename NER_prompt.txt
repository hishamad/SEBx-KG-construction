From this text, your output Must be in python dict made up of nested list made up of ['entity', 'type']
As an Example, consider the following news excerpt:
Input: 'Apple Inc. is set to introduce the new iPhone 14 in the technology sector this month. The product's release is likely to positively impact Apple's stock value.' 
OUTPUT LIST:[['Apple Inc.', 'COMP'], ['iPhone 14', 'PRODUCT'], ['Technology Sector', 'SECTOR'], ['Apple Stock Value', 'FIN_INSTRUMENT']]. 
Finally, convert this into a dictionary {"entity":["Apple Inc.", "iPhone 14", "Technology Sector", "Apple Stock Value"], "entity_type":["COMP", "PRODUCT", "SECTOR", "FIN_INSTRUMENT"]}
You must only return the dictionary and nothing more.
